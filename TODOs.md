- Normalize LiDAR point clouds and save them as .npy format (scaling must be relative to the height of the
 tallest building) :fire:
- Think about folder structure and file names for processing many tiles consecutively :fire:
- Evaluate building footprint polygon data sources (Overpass-Turbo vs. others) :fire:
- Can we combine building point clouds with street view and aerial images? :fire:

- @Kevin: Unify conda environment setup across platforms with conda-lock :+1:
- @Kevin: Develop method which adds footprint points to LiDAR-based point cloud :fire:
- @Sebastian: Normalize LiDAR point clouds and save them as .npz format (scaling must be relative to the height of the
 tallest building) --> loop through AOIs, select LiDAR tiles :fire:
- @Sebastian: visualize more buildings and do sanity check of normalization (e.g. tower of bliss tweed mill)
- @Sebastian: Contact verisk again for building footprints. :fire:
