### Areas of interest in the UK:

Existing AOIs from previous project:

- Coventry
- Peterborough
- Oxford 
- London (specifically Westminster)

Ideas for new AOIs:

- District of Liverpool >50% missing footprints in east part. or Manchester inner city seems fine, outer parts show many missing footprints
- District of Edinburgh: no/few missing footprints
- York: no/few missing footprints
- Norwich: ~30% missing footprints in north-east part
- Plymouth: ~30% missing footprints in north-east part

Note: Missing footprints refer to OSM.
