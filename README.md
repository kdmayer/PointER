## Setup Instructions

Clone repo to your local machine. Navigate into root directory.

To get started, initialize and activate the environment with

    conda env create --file=environment.yml
    conda activate cs224w
    
## Important Note: 

 - **Please do not push your changes directly to the main branch.**
 - Instead, let's develop features locally with the help of feature branches and push them to the remote with a Pull Request (PR). 
 - Suggested format for local branches: feature_name_your_name, e.g. feature_embedding_kevin
 - To save us from tedious debugging sessions, we will not merge PRs which do not execute successfully on local machines.
