## Setup Instructions

Git Clone repo to your local machine. Navigate into root directory.

To get started, initialize and activate the environment with

    conda env create --file=environment.yml
    conda activate cs224w
    
## Important Note: 

 - Please do not push your changes directly to the main branch. 
 - Instead develop your features on a feature branch on your local machine and push them to the remote with a Pull Request (PR). 
 - Format for local branches: feature_name_your_name, e.g. feature_embedding_kevin
 - PRs which do not execute on local machines will not be merged.
